# 1.Feature Transformation:
I. To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.  
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on wine 
(alcohol, ash, magnesium, and so on). Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data 
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small 
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and 
white wine by inspecting these principal components.

II.To use PCA Algorithm for dimensionality reduction.  
You have a dataset that includes measurements for different variables on milk quality. Apply PCA algorithm & transform this data 
so that most variations in the measurements of the variables are captured by a small 
number of principal components so that it is easier to distinguish between red and 
white wine by inspecting these principal components. 
III.  Apply LDA Algorithm on Iris Dataset and classify which species a given flower 
belongs to.

# 2.Regression Analysis: 
I. Predict the price of the Uber ride from a given pickup point to the agreed drop-off 
location. Perform following tasks:  
1. Pre-process the dataset.  
2. Identify outliers.  
3. Check the correlation.  
4. Implement linear regression and ridge, Lasso regression models.  
5. Evaluate the models and compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.
